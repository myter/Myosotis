# Myosotis
This application rather serves as an extensive example of CAPtain.js' capabilities than a serious grocery list application.

No idea what I'm talking about ? go check out [CAPtain.js](https://github.com/myter/CAPtain) or read the [paper](http://myter.be/papers/pre-print-onward18.pdf) ! 

# Running a Myosotis Server
Depending on which version of Myosotis you want to run:

- `node runMyosotisAP.js` 
- `node runMyosotisCP.js`

Do note that this command needs to be issued from within the `src` directory.
Moreover, Myosotis expects a running MongoDB instance (see `ExampleAppConfig.json`in the `src` folder).
